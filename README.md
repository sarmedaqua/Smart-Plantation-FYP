Problem Statement

This project aims to solve negative environmental effects faced by Pakistan through monitored plantation.  The project will cover different techniques to enhance the plantation drive by onboarding relevant stakeholders. We aim to specifically focus on how to enhance post-plantation process through continuous follow-ups.
Pakistan is particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change as only five per cent of the country has forest cover as compared to a global average of 31 per cent, making it one of the six countries most susceptible to climate change. According to Mehmood Alam Khalid, an environmental journalist from Karachi, it will be a big challenge for the government to provide resources needed post-plantation. “During the last fifteen years, there were uncountable plantation drives in Karachi but no substantial results were obtained from them,” Khalid pointed out. “The reason behind this is that there were no follow-ups,” he added (Kunbhar, 2018). In another article published in Express Tribune, the author writes: “Don’t plant 100 trees and then forget about them; plant 10 and take care of them. There’s no point in planting if your trees die due to lack of care; their survival is very crucial,” he urges. (Ilyas, 2016).
